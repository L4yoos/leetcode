### Automation with GitHub Actions

To keep these sections updated automatically, I plan to use **GitHub Actions**. This will involve a script (e.g., in Python) that:

1.  **Fetches LeetCode Data:** Gathers my latest stats and solved problems from LeetCode.
2.  **Updates `README.md`:** Dynamically generates the content for the "LeetCode Status" and "Recently Solved Problems" sections.
3.  **Commits Changes:** Pushes the updated `README.md` back to this repository.

This setup will ensure my LeetCode journey is always accurately reflected here!
